## Chapter 2


### Processes

**_1. Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of the ones in the book)._**

A real world example of virtualization is ordering a product from Amazon. To you, it seems as though you are purchasing from Amazon, yet you do not necessarily know where it is shipping from or if it from a different vendor selling through Amazon.

**_2. What is the difference between a program and a process?_**

A program can have multiple processes.

**_3. What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction?  What illusion does the process abstraction create?_**

The primary purpose of process abstraction is to make it so programmers do not need to worry about the timing of a process running, the physical address of memory, or sharing devices between processes. The illusion that the process abstraction creates is that each process has its own memory and that it is the only process running.

**_4. What is the kernel?_**

The kernel is a part of the UNIX operating system that performs the core functions such as creating threads.

**_5. What is a daemon?_**

A process that runs in the background and provides services.
