To share personal goals and decide on team goals, we wrote down our personal goals on post it notes and then read them. We then made a google doc to combine our personal goals into our team goals.

Personal Goals:
  - Learn about low level programming and memory management
  - Understand how to program microcontrollers in C
  - Learn about registers and microcontroller architecture
  - Learn more about networking or programming graphics

Team Goals:
  - Stay organized as a team
  - Make sure nobody falls behind
  - Make a cool thing that works pretty well

My team met on Saturday to set up and populate our scrum board and to decide the scrum master. We decided on the scrum master based on who was currently a scrum master for another class and voting.
