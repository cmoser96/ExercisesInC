# Reflection 1
### Carl Moser

## Personal Goals:
  - Learn about low level programming and memory management
  - Understand how to program microcontrollers in C
  - Learn about registers and microcontroller architecture
  - Learn more about networking or programming graphics

Overall, the last sprint went well. We were able to transfer the Make article program from Arduino C to C. I learned more about the arduinos architecture and how to directly change registers in this sprint. I still do not completely understand how the registers work, what they all mean and what possibilities open up when you have direct access to them. In the next sprint, I plan on reading more about microcontoller architecture in hopes of gaining a better understanding.

My team was on top of the eduScrum ceremonies. Every meeting, we had a stand up and a discussion of what we were going to do by the next meeting. We kept our trello board updated through out the sprint. Our work during the first sprint was mainly research. This prepared us for being able to set a goal for the project. The readings also prepared me for the sprint review.

## Exam Question

Reading: ThinkOS chapter 3

*What are some of the benefits of having a memory management unit(MMU) on modern processors?*

Memory management units translate virual addresses to physical addresses which allows for process abstraction. They also restrict access to memory that does not belong to a process.
