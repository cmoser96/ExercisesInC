## Homework 2
1. The program is intended to initialize an array with foo, update it with bar, and then print it out. The output of the program should be 42,42,42,42,42.

2. The warning is "function returns address of local varible." It means that memory is never allocated on the heap for the variable.

3. The pointers both point to the same memory address. It prints out 0,1,2,3,4 which is what bar() sets the array to. This happens because the memory for the array was allocated locally on the stack. When *foo() returns, the memory for it is no longer allocated for it so bar() then modifies the array that was there.

4. The first two variables are 0 and the other 3 are large integers. Locally allocated variables result in undefined behavior which is why commenting out the print statements can result in varying outcomes.
